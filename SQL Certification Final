#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables to quantify statistics about media sales.

ORDER BY inv.Total DESC
LIMIT 10;

#2, I found out how many customers each employee had assisted.

FROM employees
JOIN customers cust
ON cust.SupportRepid = employees.EmployeeId
GROUP BY employees.LastName

WITH sales AS (

FROM employees emp
JOIN customers cust ON cust.SupportRepid=emp.EmployeeId
JOIN sales ON sales.Customerid=cust.Customerid
GROUP BY emp.Employeeid
